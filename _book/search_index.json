This guide is meant for those who have little to no experience in programming. My purpose in designing these modules is to provide a brief yet clear guide to learning the basic theory of these tools and how to apply them in practice. Throughout this book, I will reference online resources that provide more in-depth discussion of the topics covered. The internet is full of helpful resources concerning R and RStudio. If you run into an issue, do not be hesitant to use forums such as stack overflow. Someone has most likely run into the same problem before. A simple Google search will often do the trick. Before starting this book, I recommend working through Professor Andy Field’s guide.1 I use his recommendations for reorganizing the windows in R Studio to promote better workflow. Most of the assignments you submit will be as a PDF output, making it important that you download LATEX, the software used to produce these outputs. The different versions of LATEX can be found here. As you are working, it can be very difficult to remember the finer points of R markdown’s syntax. RStudio has made a bunch of very helpful cheat sheets that provide examples of almost anything you might want to do.2 Those can be accessed through the help menu as demonstrated in the screenshot below: You are also able to pull up a list of markdown syntax within RStudio. This will appear in the help window of RStudio: Additionally, you can always use the search bar in the top rights of the help window to search for the documentation of any function.

# Introduction {#intro}

These modules are here to present a succinct guide to using R, RStudio, and R Markdown for data wrangling and visualization. This guide is meant for those who have little to no experience in programming. My purpose in designing these modules is to provide a brief yet clear guide to learning the basic theory of these tools and how to apply them in practice. Throughout this book, I will reference online resources that provide more in-depth discussion of the topics covered.

The internet is full of helpful resources concerning R and RStudio. If you run into an issue, do not be hesitant to use forums such as [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Someone has most likely run into the same problem before. A simple Google search will often do the trick.

Before starting this book, I recommend working through Professor Andy Field's [guide](https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-installing-r-and-rstudio).[@andy_field] I use his recommendations for reorganizing the windows in R Studio to promote better workflow. Most of the assignments you submit will be as a PDF output, making it important that you download LATEX, the software used to produce these outputs. The different versions of LATEX can be found [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

As you are working, it can be very difficult to remember the finer points of R markdown's syntax. RStudio has made a bunch of very helpful cheat sheets that provide examples of almost anything you might want to do.[@R-rmarkdown] Those can be accessed through the help menu as demonstrated in the screenshot below:
![](figures/cheatsheets.png)
You are also able to pull up a list of markdown syntax within RStudio. This will appear in the help window of RStudio:

Additionally, you can always use the search bar in the top rights of the help window to search for the documentation of any function.
